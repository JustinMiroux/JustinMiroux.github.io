        <h1>How to setup an Arma 3 server on linux.</h1>
        <p>
            Hello today i'm going to explain the steps i took to make my own Arma 3 server on linux.</br>
            Obviously you will need a machine or VM running linux.</br>
        </p>

        <h2>Install SteamCMD</h2>
        <p>
            This depends on the distro you are running. For the sake of simplicity i'm personaly using Ubuntu server (it's just good enough for me).</br>
            First of all we are going to create a user dedicated to steam and the Arma3 game.</br>
        </p>
        <code>
            sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -m steam
            sudo passwd steam
        </code>

        <p>After this we will install the libraries needed for steamCMD to run and then install steamCMD.</br></p>
        <code>
            sudo add-apt-repository multiverse && sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt update
            sudo apt install steamcmd
        </code>

        <p>Once this is done you can move to the steam user we created earlier like this</br></p>
        <code>
            sudo -u steam -s
            cd
        </code>
        
        <p>
            Then we will need to add the directory in wich steamcmd was installed into steam .bashrc</br>
            To do that just edit the .bashrc file in the home folder of the user and add this line at the end of the file :</br>
        </p>
        <code>
            PATH="$PATH:/usr/games/"
        </code>

        <p>Then just restart bash or exit and re enter the user account to apply the changes.</br></p>

        <h2>Install arma3 dedicated server.</h2>
        <p>
            First off all you will need to create a new directory (arma3) for the server files,</br>
            then start steamcmd and changes the location where the files will be installed to said directory and finally login to an account that has the game.</br>
        </p>
        <code>
            mkdir arma3
            steamcmd
            # Wait for steam cmd to load
            force_install_dir /home/steam/arma3/
            login YourSteamAccount
        </code>

        <p>Once your logged into your account you can install Arma3 Dedicated Server by doing the following</br></p>
        <code>
            app_update 233780 -beta creatordlc " validate
            # Wait for install to finish
        </code>

        <p>
            Once that is done you can exit steamcmd and go to the folder and verify that the files are indeed present.</br>
            You can also try and start the server.</br>
        </p>
        <code>
            cd arma3
            ./arma3server_x64
            # Logs will normaly start appearing
        </code>
